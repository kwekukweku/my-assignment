                0 COMMENTS 3.1  Call to Worship/Welcome In the new order, the call to worship is a way of calling the congregation's
                 attention to the  fact that the service is about to begin. After this the Choir, Singing Band and the Clergy process. In practice,
                  however, most liturgists read an appropriate passage from the Bible  and/or say a word of welcome and after the introit follow that
                   by saying "we continue our  service in the name of God the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit". It should be noted that if the procession 
                   comes before the call to worship, the service continues and does not start with the call to worship. Again in situations where the
                    service begins with the
                  procession rather than the call to worship the liturgist may join the call to worship and welcome as one item after the introit.  
                3.2  Affirmation of Faith  Generally, the Apostle's Creed is said on ordinary occasions and the Nicene Creed on  
                Communion Sundays, Christmas, Easter and other special days. It is also good for all preachers and liturgists to
                 have a good knowledge of the other new creeds that have been  added and know when they can be appropriate.  
                 The purpose of a creed is to act as a yardstick of correct belief. The creeds of Christianity  have been drawn
                  up at times of conflict about doctrine. The acceptance or rejection of a creed serves to distinguish believers
                   and deniers of a particular doctrine or set of doctrines. For that reason a creed was called in Greek a
                    sumbolon, meaning half of a broken object which, when placed together with the other half verified the
                     bearer's identity. The Greek word passed through Latin symbolum into English symbol, which later took 
                     on the meaning of an outward sign of something. 
                     <h2><a href="#" id="beef"></a> Beef</h2>
                 The Apostles' Creed is the basic creed of Reformed churches. It is a statement of Christian belief. It is
                  widely used by a number of Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes. 
                  The Apostles' Creed appears to have been originally formulated as a refutation of Gnosticism, an early heresy. 
                  This can be seen in almost every phrase. For example, the creed states that Christ Jesus was born, suffered,
                   and died on the cross. This seems to be a statement directly against the heretical teaching that Christ only 
                   appeared to become man and that he did not truly suffer and die but only appeared to do so. The Apostles' Creed,
                    as well as other baptismal creeds, are esteemed as an example of the apostles'
                  teachings and a defence of the Gospel of Christ. The Apostles' Creed does not address some Christological 
                  issues defined in the Nicene and other Christian Creeds. It thus says nothing explicitly about the divinity
                   of either Jesus or of the Holy Spirit.  
                   <h2><a href="#" id="sushi"></a>Sushi</h2>
                 The Nicene Creed is the profession of faith that is most widely used in Christian Liturgy. It is called 
                 Nicene because, in its original form, it was adopted in the city of Nicaea in 325. The Nicene Creed 
                 was adopted in the face of the Arian controversy. Arius, a Libyan preacher, had declared that although
                  Jesus Christ was divine, God had actually created him, and there was a time when he was not. This made Jesus less
                   than the Father and contradicted the doctrine of the Trinity. The Nicene Creed, therefore, explicitly affirms the 
                   divinity of Jesus applying to him the term "God." It speaks of the Holy Spirit as worshipped and glorified with the
                    Father and the Son. As Methodists, we recite the Nicene Creed to affirm that the doctrine of the Trinity, which makes
                     the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, equally divine, is true.
